Containerized Python application deployment documentation
===========================================================
This project helps you to setup your Python application in a containerized deployment, accessible through REST API. This setup can provide you with multiple advantages:
- It is easy to integrate your Python application as a microservice in your current IT infrastructure.  
- The API server is hosted locally on-premise, reducing risks concerning data leaks.  
- Containerization through Docker ensures version consistency.
